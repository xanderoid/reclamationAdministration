== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to translate widgets using WPML =

The current version of `Black Studio TinyMCE Widget` plugin works together with the `WPML String translation` plugin. To translate a widget created with `Black Studio TinyMCE Widget` plugin you have to create it on the widgets panel and then go to `WPML` -> `String translation` and translate the title and text from there (unfortunately the translation textarea has no wysywyg editor).
Note: If you installed WPML after the creation of the widgets, just re-save them and they will appear on the String translation list.

= The plugin doesn't work as expected =

Please post a message in the [Support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/black-studio-tinymce-widget), providing the following information:

* Description of the problem and steps to reproduce it
* Error messages if any (in particular in browser's javascript console)
* Browser / OS in use
* WordPress version in use
* WordPress theme in use
* List of other WordPress plugins installed

= How to embed video and other contents =

WordPress has a nice [autoembed feature](http://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds) that allows you to embed videos and other stuff in an easy way, by just putting the URL in the content area. This is also possible for widgets created with this plugin, but for best results it is recommended to put the URL inside an `[embed]` shortcode. Example: `[embed]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXXXXXXXXX[/embed]`. Ensure that the URL has not an hyperlink on it.
Alternatively, if you don't want to use `[embed]` shortcode, ensure that the URL is not surrounded by a `<p>` tag, which is added automatically by the WYSIWYG editor (switch to HTML mode to remove enclosing `<p>` tags).

= Widgets disappeared after migrating or changing the site URL =

When dealing with a WordPress site URL change it is necessary to face the "serialized fields" issue: data may become corrupted if using a simple search/replace (see the [Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Moving_WordPress#When_Your_Domain_Name_or_URLs_Change) for further info). This is not an issue specifically related to our plugin, but it affects all the parts (plugins, themes and WordPress core files too) that use serialized data archiviation. When changing the site URL, the recommended way is to use the [Search and Replace for WordPress Databases Script](https://interconnectit.com/products/search-and-replace-for-wordpress-databases/), as suggested by the Codex.
